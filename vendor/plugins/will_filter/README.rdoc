= WillFilter

will_filter is a Rails engine plugin that makes it easy to add administration tools to your site.
 
If you ever had to build a page that displays a list of objects that can be filtered using 
various criteria, this plugin can make your life easier. Adding a filtered page can now be 
a matter of adding a line of code to your controller and creating a view to display your data.

== Installation Instructions

To install, configure and initialize will_filter engine, run the following commands: 

  $ script/plugin install git://github.com/mislav/will_paginate.git

  $ script/plugin install git://github.com/berk/will_filter.git
  $ rake will_filter:sync  
  $ rake db:migrate 

  $ cd public; ln -s ../vendor/plugins/will_filter/public/wf wf

== Examples

Here is an example of how objects can be filtered in your controller:

  class ProfileController < ApplicationController
  
    def index
      @profiles = Profile.filter(:params => params)    
    end
    
  end  

Note: 'Profile' is a Rails ActiveRecord model 

That's it. Now all you have to do is create a view for this action and add the following tag where you want your filter to be rendered:

  <%= will_filter(@profiles) %>

This will render a filter box with various conditions, operators and values for the model object you selected.

Below are a couple of screenshot of what the filter looks like when it is rendered on a page:

This is a simple profiles filter that filters users who are male and their first name starts with Steven

This is a more complicated case where we are looking at a list of events that were created by users filtered using the preveous example.
